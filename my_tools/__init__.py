# itâ€™s super important to understand why __init__.py matters â€” itâ€™s not just a random file Python needs; itâ€™s what tells Python that a folder is a package that can be imported.

ðŸ§  What is __init__.py?

__init__.py is a special file that Python looks for to treat a folder as a package (a collection of modules that can be imported).

Without it, Python sees your folder (my_tools/) as just a normal folder, not something it can import from.
